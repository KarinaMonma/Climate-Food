# Climate-Food
This is a project created to gather, transform, analyze and visualize data about the connection between the climate and the food production.

This project is a study project, where some steps may be a little longer and unecessary, but this is intentional for practice and experience reason.

I totally invite you to check this project and leave feedbacks if you're interest to! Every new perspective, insight, advice, tips and even critiscism is an opportunity to learn and improve, so they are all welcome!
